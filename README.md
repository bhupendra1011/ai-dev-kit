# ai-dev-kit

A practical guide to developing software with AI coding tools. Includes an
installable skill for git workflows and progressive disclosure documentation, a
[documentation standard](docs/progressive-disclosure-standard.md) for making
repos self-describing for AI agents, and a
[multi-repo orchestration guide](docs/multi-repo-orchestration.md) (WIP). Works
with any agent — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini.

## Overview

The ai-dev-kit skill installs into your agent. At session start, a hook injects
git conventions (lowercase commits, no AI tool names, present tense) and
registers skills for git workflows and progressive disclosure documentation. Git
conventions are always active. Skills load on demand when you invoke them — say
"ship it" for git, or "generate docs" for documentation.

## Install

**Claude Code**

```
/plugin marketplace add AgoraIO-Community/ai-dev-kit
/plugin install ai-dev-kit@ai-dev-kit
```

**Cursor**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/ai-dev-kit.git ~/ai-dev-kit
ln -s ~/ai-dev-kit/skills/ai-dev-kit ~/.cursor/rules/ai-dev-kit
```

**OpenCode**

Clone the repo into your workspace (or anywhere) and OpenCode will load the local plugin from `.opencode/plugins/`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/ai-dev-kit.git ~/ai-dev-kit
```

**Any agent**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO-Community/ai-dev-kit.git
```

Point your agent at `skills/ai-dev-kit/SKILL.md` as the entry point.

## Skills Library

**Git**

| Skill | What it does                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ship  | commit staged changes and push to remote               |
| pr    | create a pull request with generated title and summary |
| sync  | rebase current branch onto latest main                 |

**Docs**

| Skill    | What it does                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| generate | create L0/L1/L2 progressive disclosure docs from scratch     |
| update   | update existing docs after code changes                      |
| test     | verify docs give agents the right context at the right level |

**Usage examples** — just ask your agent in natural language:

- "ship it" — commits staged changes and pushes
- "create a pr" — opens a pull request with generated title and summary
- "sync with main" — rebases onto latest main
- "generate docs for this repo" — creates progressive disclosure documentation
- "update the docs" — refreshes docs to reflect recent code changes
- "test the docs" — verifies docs give agents the right context

## AI Documentation Standard

Every repo should be self-describing for AI agents. The
[Progressive Disclosure Documentation Standard](docs/progressive-disclosure-standard.md)
defines a three-level architecture:

| Level  | Name       | What it is                                              | Token budget |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **L0** | Repo Card  | Identity + L1 index. Always loaded first.               | 300-500      |
| **L1** | Summaries  | Structured summaries for standard work. 8 files.        | 300-600 each |
| **L2** | Deep Dives | Full specs and subsystem docs. Loaded only when needed. | No limit     |

The `generate` skill creates these docs automatically for any repo.

## Multi-Repo Orchestration (WIP)

When features span multiple repos, you need coordination across agents. The
[Multi-Repo Orchestration Guide](docs/multi-repo-orchestration.md) describes
agent tiers, epic lifecycle, and cross-repo review patterns.

## Using with Superpowers

[Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) handles the development
pipeline — spec, plan, build, test, review. ai-dev-kit ensures consistent git
usage (clean commits, no AI tool advertising) and maintains useful progressive
disclosure documentation. No overlap:

| Concern         | ai-dev-kit             | Superpowers          |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Git conventions | ship, pr, sync         | —                    |
| Documentation   | generate, update, test | —                    |
| Spec & planning | —                      | spec, plan           |
| Development     | —                      | tdd, review          |
| Debugging       | —                      | systematic-debugging |

A typical workflow:

1. spec — capture what you want to build (Superpowers)
2. plan — design the approach (Superpowers)
3. tdd — implement with tests (Superpowers)
4. review — review the changes (Superpowers)
5. ship — commit and push (ai-dev-kit)
6. pr — create a PR (ai-dev-kit)
7. generate — update repo docs (ai-dev-kit)
